# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection System

A comprehensive end-to-end plant leaf disease detection system using Python, combining CNN model training with OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API for accurate disease identification and expert agricultural advice.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Disease Detection**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API for immediate plant analysis
- **CNN Model Training**: Optional TensorFlow/Keras model training with PlantVillage dataset
- **Expert Agricultural Advice**: GPT-4 generated treatment recommendations
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Command-line, Flask web app, and Streamlit interface
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed analysis reports and visualizations

## Quick Start (Demo Mode)

The system works immediately using OpenAI Vision API without requiring dataset download or model training:

```bash
# Create test images
python create_test_image.py

# Analyze plant disease (command line)
python plant_demo.py test_diseased_leaf.jpg

# Launch web interface
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Full System Components

### Part 1: Dataset & Model Training

```python
from plant_disease_detection import PlantDiseaseDetector

detector = PlantDiseaseDetector()
# Downloads PlantVillage dataset from Kaggle
data_path = detector.download_dataset()
# Preprocesses images (128x128, normalized)
X, y = detector.load_and_preprocess_data(data_path)
# Trains CNN for 10 epochs and saves as leafdoctor_model.h5
history = detector.train_model(X, y, epochs=10)
```

### Part 2: Prediction Function

```python
# Load saved model and predict disease
detector.load_model('leafdoctor_model.h5')
result = detector.predict_leaf_disease('plant_image.jpg')
print(f"Disease: {result['predicted_class']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2%}")
```

### Part 3: GPT Integration

```python
# Get farmer-friendly explanation and treatment advice
explanation = detector.get_gpt_explanation(result['predicted_class'])
print(explanation)
```

### Part 4: Complete Analysis with Visualization

```python
# Complete pipeline with visualization
detector.display_results(image_path, result, explanation)
```

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: PlantVillage Dataset from Kaggle
- **Classes**: 15 plant disease categories including:
  - Tomato diseases (Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, etc.)
  - Potato diseases (Early Blight, Late Blight)
  - Pepper diseases (Bacterial Spot)
  - Healthy plant samples
- **Total Images**: ~20,000 plant leaf images
- **Processing**: Resized to 128x128, normalized to [0,1]

## CNN Model Architecture

```python
Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    
    Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    
    Conv2D(256, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    
    Flatten(),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
```

## Example Output

```
PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE
================================================================================
Predicted Disease: Tomato___Early_blight
Confidence: 87.34%

Expert Advice:
Early blight is a common fungal disease affecting tomatoes, caused by Alternaria 
solani. It appears as dark brown spots with concentric rings on lower leaves.

TREATMENT OPTIONS:
Organic Methods:
1. Remove infected leaves immediately
2. Apply copper-based fungicides
3. Improve air circulation
4. Water at soil level, not on leaves

Non-Organic Methods:
1. Apply chlorothalonil-based fungicides
2. Use systemic fungicides like azoxystrobin
3. Preventive spraying every 7-14 days

PREVENTION:
- Crop rotation (3-4 years)
- Proper spacing between plants
- Mulching to prevent soil splash
- Regular monitoring for early detection

## API Integration

### OpenAI GPT-4 Vision

- **Function**: Image analysis and disease identification
- **Temperature**: 0.3 for precise analysis, 0.7 for treatment advice

### Treatment Advice Generation
```python
prompt = f"""Explain what {predicted_class} is and how to treat it in organic and non-organic ways. 
Provide step-by-step advice for a smallholder farmer including:
1. Disease overview and causes
2. Organic treatment methods
3. Non-organic treatment methods  
4. Prevention strategies
5. Timeline and monitoring
6. When to seek professional help"""
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: ~85-90% on PlantVillage test set
- **Inference Time**: 
  - CNN Model: ~100ms per image
  - OpenAI Vision: ~2-3 seconds per image
- **Supported Formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **Max File Size**: 16MB (Flask), 200MB (Streamlit)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Key Error**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key"
   ```

2. **Kaggle API Setup** (for dataset download)
   ```bash
   pip install kaggle
   # Place kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/
   ```

3. **TensorFlow GPU Issues**
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow-gpu  # For GPU acceleration
   ```

4. **Memory Issues During Training**
   - Reduce batch size in `train_model()`
   - Limit images per class in `load_and_preprocess_data()`
